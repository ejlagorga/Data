Musical Instrument Digital Interface (midi) is a language through which electronic musical instruments and computers communicate. Midi encodes discrete instances of pitch, dynamics, panning, and tempo played by up to thirty-two instruments which can be saved in a compressed format to computer memory. Without an agreed upon communication protocol for electronic instruments to encode their music there would be competing proprietary implementations rendering many instruments non-interoperable. A huge problem when starting a band! music21 is “a toolkit for computer-aided musicology” developed at MIT. It is one of many interpreters between encoded midi files and users looking to manipulate them. TensorFlow is Google’s open source machine learning framework which in tandem with music21 and MIDI can be used to train computers to generate novel jazz duets using probabilistic context-free grammars. 
</p>
<p> 
Learning takes place from a single midi file converted into a music21 stream. From the stream it is typically possible to isolate two specific scores; one which represents a tempo keeping percussion part like base chords played by a piano, and another which encodes a soloing artist on any number of instruments. The method attempts to improvise these parts in a unique manner but with representative styles. In order to capture idiomatic gestures of a specific soloist, representative contours are extracted from a music21 score using clustering, and sequencing among contours is done using Markov chains that are encoded into the grammar. 
</p>
<p> 
To improve continuity between melodic fragments, abstract melodies are clustered using k-means clustering algorithm. Then statistics that represent temporal position of clusters relative to other clusters in the midi file are used to build a Markov chain. Markov chains are systems with sequences of states, that use conditional probabilities to model the transitions between successive states. Sets of abstract melodies serve as the states in the Markov chain. Given a starting melody, we add the next phrase based on a list of transition probabilities from the initial phrase. To compose new solos, a sequence of clusters from the grammar is generated using the Markov chain, then a representative from each cluster is chosen using the grammar rules specifying the distribution of the representatives. 
</p>
<p> 
The problem with this approach is that there are many different chord progressions, even when normalized to a given tonal center, and thus requires an extremely large database. Moreover, this database would need to be manually created, which is a very labor-intensive process. The practical result of these limitations is each song has an independent set of generated grammars which reduces the flexibility of the model making the music less agreeable.
